Control Blackmagic Design cameras using Bluetooth Low Energy

Currently, for debug purposes, the bluetoothctl shell works great.
For automation purposes, you can use bash to invoke a bluetoothctl shell, but this session dies after the bash command ends, so expect can be used to continuously operate a bluetoothctl shell while receiving commands from other programs.
For low level purposes, I'm still figuring out how to invoke bluez commands in C.
