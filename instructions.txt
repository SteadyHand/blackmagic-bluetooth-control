#this works on an ubuntu 18.04 machine with bluez, hcitool, gatttool, bluetooth, etc. apt-get installed. Do the same if you get issues.

#Use bluetoothctl to pair with the pin code and enter the gatt submenu to write to characteristics

bluetoothctl
#Inside the ctl, run
agent on
scan on
#wait until you see something like "[CHG] Device D0:CF:5E:XX:XX:XX Name: Pocket Cinema Camera 4K A:10F"
scan off
#or type devices to get Device D0:CF:5E:XX:XX:XX Pocket Cinema Camera 4K A:10F
devices
#Then using the address, with the agent certainly on...
agent on
pair D0:CF:5E:XX:XX:XX
#it will prompt you for the passkey or cancel itself, just retry it in a second
#when it prompts for the passkey, the BMPCC4K will display the pin in the Setup menu and you can enter it into the bluetoothctl and it will connect, for example enter 123456
123456
#Then it will say pairing successful, so now connect to it
connect D0:CF:5E:XX:XX:XX
#then it will say connection successful.
#Woo!
#now let's write its GATT characteristics, so enter the menu
menu gatt
#now get info from its characteristics (The incoming Camera Control UUID)
#to see all the attributes
list-attributes
#to get specific info

select-attribute B864E140-76A0-416A-BF30-5876504537D9
notify on
#now, the bluetoothctl will constantly show you the status bytes, and if you hit record, it will change the status, which is cool.
#to stop it, turn off the notify
notify off
#now let's write commands to it. Select the Outgoing Camera Control Characteristic's UUID
